{"@type":"Question","name":"How do disaster relief charity scams work?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Scammers create fake charities with names similar to legitimate organizations immediately after disasters. They solicit donations through phone calls, emails, social media, text messages, and crowdfunding platforms. The money goes to the scammers, not disaster victims. Some fake charities spend less than 5% of donations on actual relief, keeping the rest as overhead and salary."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"How can I verify a disaster relief charity is legitimate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Check the charity on Charity Navigator (charitynavigator.org), GuideStar (guidestar.org), and the BBB Wise Giving Alliance (give.org). Verify registration with your state attorney general. Confirm the exact legal name and EIN. Legitimate charities have published financial statements, established track records, and IRS 501(c)(3) status. Be wary of charities created immediately after a disaster with no history."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"What percentage of disaster donations actually reach victims?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Well-rated disaster relief organizations typically spend 75-90% of donations on program services (direct aid). The best performers like Direct Relief and International Rescue Committee exceed 90%. Industry standards recommend that charities spend at least 65% on programs. Charity Navigator and GuideStar publish detailed financial breakdowns showing exactly how each organization allocates funds."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"Should I donate to GoFundMe campaigns after disasters?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Crowdfunding campaigns carry higher fraud risk than established charities. While many GoFundMe campaigns are legitimate, the platform cannot verify every campaign. Donate to crowdfunding campaigns only when you can verify the organizer's identity, the campaign has been shared by credible local sources, and GoFundMe has applied its Trust and Safety verification. For maximum impact, donate to established disaster relief organizations instead."}},
{"@type":"Question","name":"What should I do if I donated to a disaster charity scam?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Report the scam to the FTC at reportfraud.ftc.gov, your state attorney general, and the National Center for Disaster Fraud at 866-720-5721 or disaster@leo.gov. If you paid by credit card, file a chargeback dispute. If you gave the charity your financial information, monitor your accounts for unauthorized charges. Save all communications and receipts as evidence."}}

  <h2 id="scale">The Scale of Disaster Charity Fraud</h2>
  <p>Every major disaster triggers an outpouring of charitable giving -- and an equally predictable surge of fraud targeting those generous impulses. The FBI estimates that disaster-related charity fraud increases by 400 to 600 percent in the weeks following major natural disasters, with scammers exploiting the urgency, emotion, and media saturation that accompany catastrophic events. Following Hurricane Helene in 2024, the FTC and state attorneys general received over 12,000 complaints related to fraudulent disaster relief solicitations within the first 30 days.</p>
  <p>The National Center for Disaster Fraud (NCDF), a joint initiative of the Department of Justice and federal law enforcement agencies, has investigated over 100,000 complaints since its establishment. The cumulative losses from disaster-related charity fraud in the United States alone exceed $1.5 billion over the past decade. These figures represent only reported losses; the actual total is likely significantly higher because many victims do not realize they have been defrauded or do not report it.</p>
  <p>The emotional context of disaster giving makes fraud particularly effective. Donors feel urgency to help immediately, which reduces the time spent on verification. Images of suffering create emotional responses that override analytical thinking. The desire to "do something" makes donors receptive to any request for help, regardless of the source. Scammers understand and deliberately exploit these psychological dynamics, timing their solicitations to coincide with peak emotional response and media coverage.</p>

  <h2 id="how">How Disaster Relief Scams Operate</h2>
  <p>Disaster charity scams follow predictable operational patterns. Within hours of a major disaster receiving media coverage, scammers activate pre-prepared infrastructure. They register domain names related to the disaster (e.g., "HurricaneReliefFund2026.org"), create social media profiles for fake organizations, set up GoFundMe or similar crowdfunding campaigns, and begin phone solicitation operations. The speed of activation is possible because scammers maintain template operations that can be quickly customized for any disaster.</p>
  <p>The solicitation methods cover every available channel. Email campaigns go out to purchased mailing lists with urgent subject lines. Phone banks call potential donors using robocall technology and live operators. Social media ads target users who have expressed concern about the disaster. Text messages with donation links reach millions of phones. Door-to-door solicitors appear in unaffected communities claiming to collect for disaster victims. The multi-channel approach ensures maximum reach and exploits the fact that donors often encounter multiple solicitations and may donate to the first convincing one.</p>
  <p>The money rarely reaches disaster victims. Fraudulent charities typically operate in one of two modes. Pure scams collect donations and simply keep all the money, providing no disaster relief whatsoever. More sophisticated operations register as legitimate nonprofits and file the required IRS paperwork, but designate the vast majority of donations as "overhead," "administrative costs," or "fundraising expenses," with less than 5 to 15 percent reaching any form of disaster relief. This structure provides legal cover while producing outcomes indistinguishable from outright theft.</p>

  <h2 id="fake-names">Name Confusion and Lookalike Charities</h2>
  <p>One of the most effective disaster scam techniques involves creating organizations with names deliberately similar to established, trusted charities. A scammer might create "American Red Cross Relief Fund" (the real organization is simply "American Red Cross"), "Direct Relief International Foundation" (the real organization is "Direct Relief"), or "Salvation Army Disaster Fund" (the real organization is "The Salvation Army"). These names are close enough that donors who are giving quickly and emotionally do not notice the difference.</p>
  <p>The website designs for these lookalike organizations closely mirror the real organizations, using similar color schemes, imagery, and language. Some scammers scrape entire sections of legitimate charity websites and replicate them on their fake domains. The donation pages look professional and may even use real payment processing services, lending additional credibility. The only difference is where the money goes -- to the scammer rather than to disaster relief.</p>
  <p>The IRS makes it relatively easy to register a new nonprofit organization, and the process does not include verification that the organization's name does not infringe on or cause confusion with existing charities. This regulatory gap allows scammers to operate under names that are deliberately designed to capture donations intended for established organizations. By the time the IRS or state regulators take action, the disaster news cycle has passed and the scammer has collected substantial funds.</p>

  <h2 id="social">Social Media and Crowdfunding Fraud</h2>
  <p>Social media platforms and crowdfunding sites have become the primary vectors for disaster donation fraud. The ease of creating campaigns, the viral potential of emotional content, and the minimal verification requirements create ideal conditions for exploitation. Following every major disaster, hundreds to thousands of crowdfunding campaigns launch within hours, and a significant percentage are fraudulent.</p>
  <p>GoFundMe reports that approximately 10 percent of disaster-related campaigns on its platform involve some form of misrepresentation, ranging from exaggerated needs to complete fabrication. While GoFundMe has implemented identity verification and holds funds until the organizer's identity is confirmed, these measures are imperfect. Scammers use stolen identities, recruit accomplices to serve as campaign organizers, or create campaigns with technically accurate but misleading descriptions.</p>
  <p>Social media amplification compounds the problem. Fake disaster relief posts that include compelling images (often stolen from legitimate news sources) generate shares, likes, and comments that create the appearance of credibility. Facebook and Instagram groups dedicated to disaster response become infiltrated with fake donation links. Scammers create Facebook Events for fake relief drives. The platform algorithms, which prioritize engagement, may amplify fraudulent content alongside legitimate relief efforts.</p>

  <h2 id="phone">Phone and Text Message Solicitation Scams</h2>
  <p>Phone solicitation remains a highly effective channel for disaster charity fraud, particularly targeting older donors who are more likely to give over the phone and less likely to verify the soliciting organization. Robocall technology allows scammers to make millions of calls per day at minimal cost, and spoofed caller ID can make calls appear to originate from local numbers or recognized organizations.</p>
  <p>The scripts used by phone solicitors are designed to maximize emotional impact and minimize time for reflection. They describe graphic suffering, reference specific disaster events that the donor has seen in the news, and create urgency by claiming that "every minute counts." Donors are asked to provide credit card numbers immediately or told that a courier will come to collect a cash or check donation. The interaction is designed to elicit a commitment before the donor has any opportunity to verify the soliciting organization.</p>
  <p>Text message solicitation ("smishing") has grown significantly as a disaster scam channel. Scammers send text messages with donation links to large lists of phone numbers. The texts often impersonate real organizations or government agencies ("FEMA disaster relief -- donate here to help"). The links lead to fake donation pages that collect both money and personal information, creating dual exploitation of the victim's generosity and identity.</p>

  <div class="callout">
    <div class="callout-title">Never Donate in Response to Unsolicited Contact</div>
    <p>Legitimate disaster relief organizations accept donations through their official websites and established channels. They do not cold-call donors, send unsolicited text messages with donation links, or go door-to-door collecting cash. If you receive an unsolicited request for a disaster donation, do not give. Instead, go directly to a verified charity's official website and donate through their established channels.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="verify">How to Verify Disaster Relief Organizations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Charity Navigator (charitynavigator.org):</strong> The largest charity evaluator in the United States, rating organizations on financial health, accountability, and transparency. Look for ratings of 3 or 4 stars.</li>
    <li><strong>GuideStar / Candid (guidestar.org):</strong> Provides comprehensive information on nonprofits including IRS filings, financial statements, and organizational details. A Platinum or Gold Seal of Transparency indicates strong disclosure practices.</li>
    <li><strong>BBB Wise Giving Alliance (give.org):</strong> Evaluates charities against 20 accountability standards covering governance, finances, fundraising, and effectiveness.</li>
    <li><strong>State attorney general:</strong> Most states require charities that solicit donations to register. Your state attorney general's website allows you to verify that a charity is registered and in good standing.</li>
    <li><strong>IRS Tax Exempt Organization Search:</strong> Verify that the organization has 501(c)(3) status by searching their name or EIN on the IRS website.</li>
    <li><strong>Direct verification:</strong> Visit the charity's official website by typing the URL directly (do not click links in emails or texts). Call their published phone number. Confirm that any campaign you have seen is officially sanctioned by the organization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="best">Best Disaster Relief Organizations to Support</h2>
  <p>The following organizations have established track records, high ratings from independent evaluators, and demonstrated effectiveness in disaster relief. Supporting established organizations rather than new or unknown entities significantly reduces fraud risk.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Direct Relief:</strong> 100% program efficiency rating. Provides medical supplies and equipment to disaster-affected areas worldwide. Four-star Charity Navigator rating consistently.</li>
    <li><strong>American Red Cross:</strong> The largest disaster relief organization in the United States. Provides shelter, food, emotional support, and recovery assistance. Despite past controversies about overhead, remains the primary coordinator of disaster response in collaboration with FEMA.</li>
    <li><strong>International Rescue Committee:</strong> Highly rated for refugee and disaster response. Efficient operations with over 90% of funds going to program services.</li>
    <li><strong>World Central Kitchen:</strong> Chef Jose Andres' organization provides immediate food relief in disaster zones. Known for rapid deployment and efficient operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Team Rubicon:</strong> Veteran-led disaster response organization that deploys skilled volunteers for cleanup, rebuild, and humanitarian relief.</li>
    <li><strong>Local community foundations:</strong> Your local community foundation often has disaster relief funds that channel donations directly to affected communities with minimal overhead.</li>
  </ul>
